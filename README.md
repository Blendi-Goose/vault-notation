# vault-notation
Chances are, I will forget about this project, it will be lost to time. However, the chance is slim that this will be finished.

Goals of this project:
For me to learn Python (this is my first project lol)
For vaults to be more readibly solvable without as much tediousness
For someone to hopefully make a vault notation program that writes vault notation. I am not doing UI. Just no.
The farthest reaching goal, is that some simple vaults can be brute forced, and bigger vaults can be breached by making subgoals that when achieved allow for the program to start from that state, iterating until completion.
